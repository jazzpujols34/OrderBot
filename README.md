# Pizza Ordering Bot

This is a simple script that demonstrates an interaction with a hypothetical Pizza Ordering Bot. The bot is designed to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. It greets the customer, collects the order, and determines if the order is for pickup or delivery.

**Disclaimer:** This project is based on a tutorial from Deeplearning.ai. The code was written as a part of my learning process and is published on GitHub for educational purposes. All rights belong to their respective owners.

## How it works

The bot uses a context-based approach for the conversation. The context is an accumulation of the conversation messages. It includes a system message that instructs the bot about its role and provides the menu. The conversation is then carried out in a GUI where user input is collected, a response is generated by the bot, and both are appended to the context.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have `panel` installed. You can install it via pip:

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have `panel` installed. You can install it via pip: pip install panel


## Running the script

You can simply run the script via Python: python script_name.py


This will open a GUI in your browser where you can interact with the bot. Type your message into the input box and click the 'Chat!' button to send it. The conversation will be displayed below the input box.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief overview of what the main functions do:

- `collect_messages(_)`: This function collects user input, gets a response from the bot, and displays both in the GUI. It updates the context with each interaction.
- `get_completion_from_messages(context)`: This function generates the bot's response based on the current context. Note that the actual implementation of this function is not included in the provided code.

## Note

This script is a demonstration and does not actually submit orders to a restaurant or process payments. It's a simple example of how you might structure a conversation with a bot that's tasked with taking pizza orders.

## Future Enhancements

The last part of the script suggests creating a JSON summary of a completed food order, itemizing the price for each item. The required fields are: 

1. Pizza (including size)
2. List of toppings
3. List of drinks (including size)
4. List of sides (including size)
5. Total price

However, the implementation of this feature is not included in the provided code. It could be an excellent addition for future development.
